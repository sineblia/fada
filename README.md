# Fada (Fast Database for Big Data)

Hey there! Guess a concise and good README is a great launchpad for an ambitious project like this one.
In my professional and academic journey, I've encountered a diverse array of databases. Many started as open-source projects, evolved into startups, and later transformed into large corporations (think MongoDB and similar stories). However, one exception remains â€“ Redis, a brainchild of my idol Salvatore Sanfilippo.
We use databases daily, often unaware of their core essence and inner workings at the source code level. Initially simple, these databases have progressively expanded their feature sets over the years. That's good, they're versatile and powerful. But sometimes, it's overkill for certain projects.

Here's why I'm developing Fada:

1. It needs to be blazing fast (with a in-memory part).
2. I aim for it to be minimalist and as lightweight as possible.
3. It must be scalable and adaptable, yet capable of handling Big Data.
4. I want to discover the art of coding: I want to learn how to write code in a more elegant and refined way, and I want to discover the beauty of implementing certain algorithms and data structures by getting as close as possible to machine language.
5. It's going to be open-source.

## My vision

My vision is a compact and efficient NoSQL document-based database, designed to deliver high performance for both in-memory and on-disk operations. At its core, the database will feature an LRU (Least Recently Used) caching mechanism. I'll try to optimize disk operations through batch writing techniques.

In terms of data storage, I plan to use optimized data structures, tailored to balance speed and memory efficiency. To further enhance performance, the database will incorporate data compression capabilities, reducing storage requirements and potentially improving read/write speeds. 

Please, don't expect strict deadlines and give me all the feedbacks you prefer. 
At the state of art, Fada is not ready to be deployed in a productive environment. But that's the long-term goal.
